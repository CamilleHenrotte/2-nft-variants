# What might the wrapped NFT pattern be used for?

### Collective ownership

Wrapped NFTs can be used to represent fractional ownership of an NFT. By wrapping an original NFT into a new contract, multiple people can collectively own fractions of it, each holding a token that represents a share of the original asset.

### Yield farming

Users could deposit their NFTs into a smart contract and receive a wrapped version of the NFT in return. The deposited NFT could be staked in the contract, and over time, the staker could earn rewards such as additional tokens or other benefits, just like with traditional token-based yield farming.

### Voting

Wrapped NFTs can be converted into governance tokens. For example, users can wrap their NFTs into tokens that grant voting rights in decentralized organizations, enabling governance participation while still holding their original asset.

### Token Upgradability

Wrapping an NFT allows for upgrades or modifications without altering the original asset. The wrapped token could add new features, governance rights, or utility to the NFT, while the original remains unchanged.

### Renting

Wrapping NFTs can enable a rental or leasing system where users deposit their NFTs into a contract and receive wrapped tokens. The wrapped token could grant usage rights for a specific period, allowing NFT owners to lease their assets temporarily.
